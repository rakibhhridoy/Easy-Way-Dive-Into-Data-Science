## This repo consist learning:
```bash
numpy                                             linear algebra
pandas                                            gradient descent
matplotlib                                        algorithm from scratch
scipy                                             multivariate calculus
statsmodel                                        statistics
tensorflow                                        frequential statistics
scikit-learn                                      bayesian statistics
seaborn                                           all formula fr ds
```


## Pre requirements

##### *Make sure you have ```Python``` installed. If you haven't python installed you can get from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)..
Or you can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) for easy access of all libraries.*

##### After Installing ```Python``` let's install our necessary libraries. Open *```Python Command Promp```* and type the following *Not needed in Anaconda Situation:
```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install keras
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
pip install statsmodel
pip install sklearn
pip install seaborn
```

##### For using any libraries you have to import the file first
```python
import pandas as pd                   #pd is alias of pandas & so others
import numpy as np
import matplotlib as mp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import sklearn as sk
import tensorflow as tf
import statsmodel as sm
import scipy as sc
```
#### If you are not get any error till now, lets dive into the notebooks that is provided in *****```Notebook```***** folder.
